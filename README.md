First homework is due on Feb 5th, 11:59 PM, 2021 (CST).

Second Homework:
Random generator when run gives the random numbers as output in the Random.txt file.
To generate the random numbers, type in python3 Random_Generator.py -<seed>

homework_two.py , when run reads the Random.txt file and gives the histogram as the output
To generate the plot, type in 'python3 homework_two.py'


Being greedy for BONUS, played a little bit with plot only to make it look ugly.
