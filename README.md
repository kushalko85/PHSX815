First homework is due on Feb 5th, 11:59 PM, 2021 (CST).

# Second Homework
Generating random numbers, writing them in a text file and plotting them to a histogram by reading the text file.

## 1) Generating random numbers and writing them in a text file
The python file `Random_Generator.py` generates random numbers, writes them to the file `random.txt`, and saves the text file.
To run this program from the terminal, type in:

	<> python3 Random_Generator.py -<seed>

## 2) Making a histogram plot of the generated random numbers
The python file `homework_two.py` reads the `random.txt` text file, creates a list and then makes the histogram plot. The plot is saved to a `plot.png` file.
To run this program from the terminal, type in:

	<> python3 homework_two.py

The code must be run in order. Libraries numpy and matplotlib are required to run the programs.
